Someone sent me [this X post](https://x.com/CoachDanGo/status/2005855611112554561), so I figured I would give it a try with Claude Opus 4.5 and GLM 4.7. The initial plan was an [interview-style](https://claude.ai/share/4520d196-5bdb-45b2-92c8-1b80e987e500) chat with Claude to plan, then I initialized `beads` with a pi hook in [`.pi/hooks/bd-prime.ts`](.pi/hooks/bd-prime.ts) and duplicated the repo.
